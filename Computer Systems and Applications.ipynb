    "The executions show inconsistent results, especially for large values of `n`. \n",

    "When `n` is relatively small, the results shows more correct results, this might be due to several reasons such as caching or CPU pipelining, thread starting time and scheduling, etc., For instance, the shorter execution time in which `thread1` might have finished changing the shared `result` variable before `thread2` finished its execution, which then decreases the likelihood of conflict. When `n` is large, the time for `thread1` to execute all of its loop iterations might be significantly longer, which then leads to situation where both `thread1` and `thread2` trying to access and modify the shared `result` variable at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential issues**\n",

    "The results of the thread executions with different values of `n` show that as value `n` increases, there is also a higher chance of encountering incorrect results, as both `thread1` and `thread2` trying to enter critical section to access the shared resource simultaneously, which leads to unpredictability in the outputs. Eventhough Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread can execute at a time, however, context switching might still happen when another thread is waiting. This pattern is indicative of a race condition (main reason for inconsistent outputs of `t2.py`) where the program does not handle the synchronization of threads accessing and modifying the shared `result` variable. Other contributing reasons might include MacOS's thread scheduler, thread preemption, real-time scheduling policies, etc., however, these factors only worsen the situation where race condition happens without proper synchronization mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fix this concurrency problem, a suitable synchronization mechanism should be employed to ensure that `thread2` does not start multiplying `result` until `thread1` has finished adding the numbers. This can be achieved through multiple ways, such as adopting semaphores (access control through the use of a counter) or mutexes (threading lock to ensure mutual exlusion) through `threading.Lock()` or `threading.Semaphore()` in Python. Monitors with conditional variables could also solve this problem, where `thread2` waits on a condition variable until `thread1` gives signal that it has finished. Another solution could be using barrier, in which `thread2` would only process if `thread1` has passed the barrier. Furthermore, thread safe data structures such as Python's `queue` module with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) implementation can also ensure the order of thread execution where `thread2` only retrieves `result` after `thread1` has finished. \n",

Both `process1` and `process2` are now accepting `q` as a parameter, enabling them to retrieve and update the value of `x`, ensuring safe inter-process communication.
